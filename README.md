# VR Injection Simulation (Unity • Meta Quest 3 • Inverse3 Haptics)

## Description
Training in medical procedures such as needle insertions often relies on limited physical resources and direct supervision, which can restrict practice opportunities and increase the risk of errors during real clinical settings. To address this challenge, the Multimodal VR Simulation with Inverse3 Haptic Device project seeks to create a virtual reality-based training platform that realistically simulates the process of inserting a needle into a patient’s arm. The project leverages immersive technologies and haptic feedback to enhance procedural learning within a safe, controlled, and repeatable environment. By integrating the Inverse3 haptic device with the Meta Quest 3 VR headset, this project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical instruction and hands-on clinical experience, offering a scalable and accessible training tool for medical students and healthcare professionals.

To revolutionise medical education by providing an immersive, realistic, and interactive visual simulation for training essential procedural skills such as needle insertions, thereby improving clinical competence and patient safety.

**Goals**
- Develop a fully integrated desktop simulation system combining the Inverse3 haptic device and Meta Quest 3 VR headset.
- Provide tactile and visual realism that accurately mimics human anatomy and the sensation of syringe insertion.
- Produce comprehensive technical and user documentation to support training and future system development.

**Project Aims**
- Create a realistic, interactive training tool for medical students to practise needle insertion techniques safely.
- Enhance clinical education and confidence by simulating realistic tactile feedback and environmental immersion.
- Provide a foundation for future extensions to cover different medical specialisations and procedures.
